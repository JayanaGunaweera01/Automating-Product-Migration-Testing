:small_blue_diamond: A migration client is provided to handle the WSO2 Identity Server migration between different product versions.

:small_blue_diamond: The client needs to be tested manually when we do a new release with different infrastructure combinations such as database and OS.

:small_blue_diamond: We can reduce that overhead by automating the migration client test execution.:v:
